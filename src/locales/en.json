    "title": "Turning ideas into",
    "titleHighlight": " intelligent systems",
    "paragraph1": "I'm a Gen AI engineer on a mission to turn ideas into intelligent, creative systems. After five years exploring almost every corner of IT; from code and data to workflows and pipelines; I finally found my sweet spot: generative AI.",
    "paragraph2": "This year, I've been all in, building, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs, designing systems that can think, create, and collaborate. I may not have papers to prove it, but I have years of real, hands-on experience, contributing to personal projects, local initiatives, and building things that actually work. I care deeply about understanding the full picture; how models behave, how they can fail, and how to make them reliable in the real world.",
    "paragraph3": "I'm fascinated by the playground of LLMs, agents, and pipelines, and I'm always chasing ways to push AI further; safer, smarter, and more useful. If it involves Gen AI, experimentation, or imagining what's next, that's where you'll find me.",
